    "#\n",
    "#- Use 4-space indentation, and no tabs.\n",
    "#4 spaces are a good compromise between small indentation \n",
    "#(allows greater nesting depth) and large indentation (easier to read). \n",
    "#Tabs introduce confusion, and are best left out. \n",
    "#- Wrap lines so that they don’t exceed 79 characters.\n",
    "#This helps users with small displays and makes it possible to \n",
    "#have several code files side-by-side on larger displays.\n",
    "#- Use blank lines to separate functions and classes, and larger blocks of \n",
    "#code inside functions.\n",
    "#- When possible, put comments on a line of their own.\n",
    "#- Use docstrings.\n",
    "#- Use spaces around operators and after commas, but not directly inside \n",
    "#bracketing constructs: a = f(1, 2) + g(3, 4).\n",
    "#- Name your classes and functions consistently; the convention is to use \n",
    "#UpperCamelCase for classes and lowercase_with_underscores for functions \n",
    "#and methods. Always use self as the name for the first method argument \n",
    "#(see A First Look at Classes for more on classes and methods).\n",
    "#- Don’t use fancy encodings if your code is meant to be used in \n",
    "#international environments. Python’s default, UTF-8, or even plain ASCII \n",
    "#work best in any case.\n",
    "#- Likewise, don’t use non-ASCII characters in identifiers if there is only \n",
    "#the slightest chance people speaking a different language will read or \n",
